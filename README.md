# Transition-path-compuation-of-the-conformational-changes-in-proteins-using-the-string-method
Hello,

This repository contains the instruction to compute the transition path of a process going from one state to another state. The approach utilises the idea of the string method and incorporated in Gromacs and Plumed.
The manuscript pdf file is also uplodaed along with the supplementary information to give the idea of the novality of the work and possible applications.
Follow the string method manual pdf file. The attached file contains all the necessary instructions and codes for alanine-dipeptide test case. Change the WORKING-DIRECTORY to your current directory address. A similar analysis can easily be perfomed with any other system for any number of collective variables provided the CVs are available in the Plumed.

Feel free to contact me in case of any difficulty.

Thank You!
Have a Nice Day!
